## Overview üìù
Uzumaki is Japan's first co-living space for researchers dedicated to solving Ethereum's most critical issues. Researchers and engineers in the fields of cryptography and economics live together and work on problem-solving.

Main activities include:
- **Share House Operation**: Accommodates about 8-10 residents
- **Event Management**: Held monthly, totaling 12 times
- **The share house is scheduled to operate from January to December 2025**

## Purpose üß≠
The goal is to create an environment where researchers and industries related to cryptography and economics can coexist and collaboratively tackle problem-solving in an emergent manner. Japan has many researchers and engineers involved in cryptography and economics, but there are limited opportunities for them to connect horizontally and engage in offline discussions. This is also true for non-Japanese-speaking researchers and engineers. By improving the connections between highly specialized individuals and enhancing cross-domain communication, we aim to foster innovation.

Additionally, we recognize the lack of knowledge sharing and collaborative research between academia and industry as a problem. By creating a research hub that is accessible to industries and engineers, we aim to establish an environment where researchers can stay focused on real-world issues without distraction.

## What We Are Not üöß
- We do not prefer hosting large parties; instead, we maintain a space where small groups can gather for meaningful conversations.
- Our share house is dedicated to research. It is not intended for fundraising or launching specific projects but rather for discussing and researching particular topics.

## Sponsorship ü§ù
We offer sponsorship opportunities for companies that resonate with our activities, priced at 1 million yen per unit (for one year).

Sponsorship benefits include:
- Unlimited visits/accommodations
- Co-hosting events
- Securing a slot for lightning talks
- Logo placement on pages (event participation pages, official house page, etc.)
- Placement of swag or materials within the house

## Past Activities üìú

We have previously organized related share houses/events. Here are two selected events:

- [MEV Tokyo](https://x.com/keccak255/status/1823593944837709938): A short-term research house where researchers and developers related to Ethereum's economic domain gathered from around the world under one roof. During this period, three events were held [[1](https://lu.ma/ei1byzjh), [2](https://lu.ma/9ha1tvgh), [3](https://lu.ma/wfpghc0t)], sharing insights on the latest incentive issues with researchers from various fields.
  
- [Progcrypto Camp](https://lu.ma/1rg8psb1): A four-day camp for those working on cryptographic technologies related to Ethereum (ZKP, MPC, FHE, iO, TEEs, etc.). It offered workshops for beginners, diverse sessions from university professors, PhDs, research institutes, and businesses in various fields, as well as spaces for individual research. Participants tackled significant unresolved issues worldwide such as zkVM, post-quantum cryptography, iO, Verifiable FHE, secret computation, etc.
